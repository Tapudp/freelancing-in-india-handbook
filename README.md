# Freelancing In India: A Handbook üìó ‚òîÔ∏è

## Overview

### Why put together this handbook?

The framework is a mess. Consulting chartered accountant, banks, and the tax office, all of whom have their own version of the law, is a headache you shouldn't deal with when you're just starting out. This is to simply things for you - give you a simple and comprehensive starting point to make sense of things.

### TL:DR;

Theoretically, you do not need anything whether you have foreign clients or just domestic clients, as long as you're earning below 20 lakhs per annum.

Beyond that, GST registration becomes compulsory.

### Some Gotchas

### Constitution of your business

* Individual and sole proprietorship are different things. You need a registration under Shops & Establishment Act, 1932, for the latter. An individual operates in their personal capacity.

#### GST
* Export is considered inter-state supply.
* Zero-rated is not the same as exempt. 0% =/= Nil.

#### Banks
* Most banks do not issue an Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate. To avoid making a mess, ask your branch of interest prior to opening an account with them. HDFC is anecdotally known to issue eFIRCs - though you may have to try your luck.
* The purpose code applicable to you will be **P0802 (Software consultancy/implementation, other than those covered in SOFTEX forms)**.

This only corresponds to web development/freelance coding at the moment.

I am not legally liable for anything that you pick up from here and use. Use your discretion. Consult a chartered accountant and/or a lawyer. This is a handbook for legal how-tos, but that does not mean it maintains legal standing or integrity.

Rules change frequently. I may not have kept up. You're free to open a PR to help other folks out.
